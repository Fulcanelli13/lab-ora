# Lab-Ora
Lab-ora is a Catholic prayer and practice companion built around the rhythm of ora et labora — pray and work.
It gathers the essential toolkit of Catholic prayer: from foundational texts and litanies to guides for Confession and Adoration, all in one simple, offline app.

## Developer Story
Hi, I'm **Andy Finette**. I developed Lab-ora primarily to encourage my friends, family, and myself to pray **the full devotional Rosary** (with verses and Litanies) and to facilitate regular **Confession**.

The Rosary can sometimes feel overwhelming. I wanted to help with better meditation by offering **scriptural verses** that anchor the contemplation of our Lord's life through His Mother's perspective.
It also serves the deeper need of anyone lacking inspiration or structure for prayer, including a guide to frequenting the Sacrament of Reconciliation.
I hope you will use it, share it, and give glory to God.

## Why Use a Prayer App?
Many users know their core prayers by heart, but Lab-ora’s strength lies in its **language toolkit**.

It provides high-quality traditional translations: **English, Latin, French, and Irish (Gaeilge)**.
Sometimes, reading the **English translation** of a prayer you only know by heart in Latin or French can refresh your meditation and understanding.
The app helps those moving between cultures (e.g., Ireland and France) to **adapt their prayer life** across different languages easily.

## Install as an Offline App (PWA)
